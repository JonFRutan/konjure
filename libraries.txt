Libraries:
Scikit-Learn - https://scikit-learn.org/stable/
Machine learning library.
Data analysis, regression analysis, clustering, object classification.
This admittedly does almost all the AI-related work in my project.

Pickle - https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html
Used for serializing and de-serializing a Python object.
I will use pickle to save on processing time by avoiding having the vectorize and fit my model every time I invoke a call.
