Konjure

Konjure is my first attempt at creating an AI model. It will be solely focused on linux/terminal commands.
My hope is to integrate Konjure with an API and have to able to be called upon within a terminal/shell for help executing some scripts.

python3 -m venv sklearn-env
'-m' runs a module as a script, in our vase 'venv'.
'venv' is a module that creates a virtual environment.
The purpose of the virtual environment is to isolate and easily manage the required dependencies.
